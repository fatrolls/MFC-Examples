<H2>The AUTOLAUNCH Sample</H2>
<P>The AUTOLAUNCH Sample accompanies Chapter 12 and illustrates how to launch an application automatically upon device attachment.</P>
<P>The sample includes four components:</P>

<UL>
<LI>AUTOLAUNCH.EXE and ALNCH98.EXE (AutoLaunch subdirectory) are user-mode service modules for Windows 2000 and Windows 98, respectively. </LI>
<LI>TSTLNCH.SYS (SYS subdirectory) is a WDM driver for a non-existent hardware device. </LI>
<LI>ALTEST.EXE (ALTEST subdirectory) is a Win32 application that will be invoked automatically whenever a new TSTLNCH device is detected. </LI>
<LI>STARTSERVICE.DLL (STARTSERVICE subdirectory) is a DLL for use during Windows 2000 installations in order to get the AUTOLAUNCH service running the very first time.</LI></UL>

<H3>Building AUTOLAUNCH</H3>
<P>To build TSTLNCH.SYS, follow the <A HREF="../../wdmbook.htm#wdmbuild">general instructions for building a WDM sample</A>. The Microsoft Visual C++ project file is named TSTLNCH.DSP in the SYS subdirectory.</P>
<P>To build the other components, follow the <A HREF="../../wdmbook.htm#usermodebuild">general instructions for building user-mode programs</A>. The Microsoft Visual C++ project files are named AUTOLAUNCH.DSP, ALTEST.DSP, and STARTSERVICE.DSP in the AUTOLAUNCH, ALTEST, and STARTSERVICE subdirectories, respectively.</P>
<P>The AUTOLAUNCH project contains subprojects for the Windows 2000 service and the Windows 98 pseudo-service. Don't forget to build both subprojects.</P>
<H3>Testing AUTOLAUNCH</H3>
<P>Install the TSTLNCH "device." Follow the general instructions for using <A HREF="../../wdmbook.htm#fastinst">FastInst</A> in Windows 2000 or the <A HREF="../../wdmbook.htm#win98inst">Add New Hardware</A> wizard in Windows 98. The INF file is named SYS\DEVICE.INF.</P>
<P>Installing the TSTLNCH device automatically starts the AUTOLAUNCH or ALNCH98 service, which in turn automatically invokes ALTEST. You should expect to see a dialog box on the screen indicating the automatic invocation of ALTEST.</P>
<P>To prevent the AUTOLAUNCH service from running in this and future sessions of Windows 2000, open a command prompt and issue these two commands:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>C:\&gt;<U>net stop autolaunch</U><BR>
C:\&gt;<U>autolaunch -unregister</P></DIR>
</DIR>

</U><P>To prevent the ALNCH98 applet from running in this and future sessions of Windows 98, follow this procedure:</P>
<OL>

<LI>Right-click on the ALNCH98 icon in the icon tray. Select the Close choice and answer the ensuing dialog question in the affirmative.</LI>
<LI>Remove the entry named AutoLaunchService from the registry key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\ Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run".</LI></OL>
