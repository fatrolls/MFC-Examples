<H2>The FEATURE Sample</H2>
<P>The FEATURE Sample accompanies Chapter 11 and illustrates how to set and clear device features.</P>
<P>The sample includes three components:</P>

<UL>
<LI>FEATURE.SYS (SYS subdirectory) is a WDM driver for a USB device based on the Anchor Chips development board. </LI>
<LI>TEST.EXE (TEST subdirectory) is a Win32 console application for testing FEATURE.SYS. </LI>
<LI>FEATURE.HEX (EZUSB subdirectory) is the firmware image for the FEATURE device.</LI></UL>

<H3>Building FEATURE</H3>
<P>To build FEATURE.SYS, follow the <A HREF="../../wdmbook.htm#wdmbuild">general instructions for building a WDM sample</A>. The Microsoft Visual C++ project file is named FEATURE.DSP in the SYS subdirectory.</P>
<P>To build TEST.EXE, follow the <A HREF="../../wdmbook.htm#usermodebuild">general instructions for building user-mode programs</A>. The Microsoft Visual C++ project file is named TEST.DSP in the TEST subdirectory.</P>
<H3>Testing FEATURE</H3>
<P>First follow the <A HREF="../../wdmbook.htm#usbtest">general instructions for testing USB samples</A> to install the device firmware (FEATURE.HEX in the EZUSB subdirectory) and the driver. Then open a command prompt and run TEST.EXE from the TEST\DEBUG subdirectory a few times. Each time TEST runs, the LED display on the development board will display a digit for about five seconds. The digit will increase each time you run TEST.</P></BODY>
