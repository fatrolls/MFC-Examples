<h2><a name="Features"></a>Features</h2>


<ul>
  <li>Subclasses the message box window to allow additional customisation.</li>
  <li>Sub classed using a standard CWnd derived class, so you can use standard 
	MFC message maps in the class itself and any classes you derive from it.</li>
  <li>Implements standard support for automatic addition of icons just like in 
	MFC.</li>
  <li>Allows custom icons to be easily added to the message box.</li>
  <li>Implements timed out message box support with specific timeout button. The 
	timeout can also be reset based on mouse or keyboard activity.</li>
  <li>Implements disabled button support. Helpful where you want to implement 
	Nag screens when you want to remind an end user to register your product.</li>
	<li>Implements support for including checkboxes on the message box. For 
	example you can implement &quot;Don't remind me again&quot; type message boxes.</li>
	<li>Includes support for right aligned buttons instead of the default for 
	the MessageBox API which is to have the buttons cantered.</li>
  <li>As of v1.05, the classes are now designed for VC 2005 or later. They will 
	not compile on earlier releases of VC. </li>
  <li>Integrates with MFC support for message box help context.</li>
  <li>Fully Unicode compliant.</li>
	<li>Optionally supports HTML in your message box via the QHTM HTML control 
	provided at <a href="http://www.gipsysoft.com/qhtm/">
	http://www.gipsysoft.com/qhtm/</a>.</li>
	<li>Supports selectable text in your message boxes.</li>
	<li>Includes support for user defined animated text and captions</li>

<h2><a name="History"></a>History</h2>

<p><strong>V1.0 (19 April 2003)</strong><ul>
  <li>Initial public release.
    </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>V1.01 (24 April 2006)</strong><ul>
  <li>Updated copyright details.</li>
	<li>Updated documentation to use the same style as the web site.</li>
	<li>UpdateCaptionDueToTimer method has been renamed to UpdateUIDueToTimer</li>
	<li>Now includes support for including a check box on the MessageBox. To 
	achieve this simply call SetCheckBox with the text to show on the check box 
	and its initial checked state prior to calling DoModal to show the message 
	box. Then when DoModal returns simple call GetCheckBoxState to determine 
	whether the check box was ticked or not.</li>
	<li>Now includes support for right aligning buttons instead of the default 
	for the MessageBox API which is to have the buttons centered. The support 
	for checkboxes and right aligned buttons is inspired by the GSMessageBox 
	article at <a href="http://www.gipsysoft.com/messagebox/">
	http://www.gipsysoft.com/messagebox/</a>.</li>
	<li>Both SetTimeout and SetDisabledButton methods now include a 
	&quot;bModifyCaptionDuringCountdown&quot; which determines if they should cause the 
	MessageBox caption to be modified during their timer countdowns</li>
	<li>Updated the sample app to allow most of the functionality of the code to 
	be optionally tested.</li>
	<li>SetTimeout method now includes a bResetTimeoutOnUserActivity parameter.
    </li>
	<li>Addition of GetCurrentTimerCaption() and GetCurrentDisabledCaption() 
	virtual methods which allow the timeout and disabled captions to be easily 
	customized at runtime.</li>
	<li>Fixed a number of compiler warnings when the code is compiled using 
	/Wp64</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>V1.02 (3 July 2006)</strong><ul>
	<li>Code now uses newer C++ style casts instead of C style casts.</li>
	<li>Class now allows you to put HTML text into the message box. This is 
	provided by the QHTM HTML control provided at
	<a href="http://www.gipsysoft.com/qhtm/">http://www.gipsysoft.com/qhtm/</a>. 
	You may need to purchase a license (depending on the type of application you 
	are developing) as well as follow their instructions on deploying 
	it if you want this functionality with CMessageBoxX. This functionality by 
	default is not included in CMessageBoxX and is only available when you 
	define the preprocessor macro &quot;CMESSAGEBOXX_HTML_SUPPORT&quot;.</li>
	<li>Implemented support for selectable text. This means that end-users can 
	select the text in the message box and paste it into the clipboard. Very 
	helpful if you want end-users to record the details of error messages etc in 
	your apps.</li>
	<li>Button captions can now be modified via SetModifiedButtonCaption.</li>
	<li>Added user defined animated text support.</li>
	<li>Added user defined animated caption support.</li>
	<li>Updated code to clean compile on VC 2005.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>V1.03 (5 November 2006)</strong><ul>
	<li>Minor update to stdafx.h of sample app to avoid compiler warnings in VC 
	2005.</li>
	<li>Code now uses QHTM const for the class name</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>V1.04 (11 August 2007)</strong><ul>
	<li>Updated copyright details.</li>
	<li>Check box text control is now clipped to the width of the main text 
	control if its calculated width will exceed the message box client area. 
	This was done following a report from Kyle Alons that this text can get 
	clipped on Vista when you pick a longish piece of text as the check box 
	text. You should ensure you pick a shortish piece of text to avoid this 
	problem as well as test all your message boxes on all the operating systems 
	you will be supporting your application on.</li>
	<li>Addition of a CMESSAGEBOXX_EXT_CLASS to allow the code to be more easily 
	added to an extension dll.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>V1.05 (11 July 2008)</strong><ul>
	<li>Updated copyright details.</li>
	<li>Updated sample app to clean compile on VC 2008</li>
	<li>Removed VC 6 style classwizard comments from the code.</li>
	<li>The code has now been updated to support VC 2005 or later only. </li>
	<li>Code now compiles cleanly using Code Analysis (/analyze)</li>
	<li>Code now uses newer C++ style casts instead of C style casts.</li>
	<li>Updated sample app to demonstrate support for user icons</li>
	<li>Class now correctly handles the manifest contexts which the MessageBox 
	API's can have when you are using Common Control v6 or later</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="Usage"></a>Usage</h2>

<ul>
  <li>To use the class in your code simple include MessageBoxX.cpp in your 
	project and #include MessageBoxX.h in which ever of your modules needs to 
	make calls to the class. </li>
  <li>You also need to copy across all the IDS_MESSAGEBOXX_* string resources 
	from the sample app to your application.</li>
  <li>Included with the download is a very simple dialog based which exercises 
	all of the functionality of the class. You should be able to get an idea on 
	how to use the class by examining the code in this sample.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="Enhancements"></a>Planned Enhancements</h2>
<ul>
  <li>If you have any other suggested improvements for CMessageBoxX, please let 
	me know so that I can incorporate them into the next release of 
	CMessageBoxX.</li>
