<h4>OK so you have this cool code, now what do you do?</h4>

<p>To make life easier all round we would ask that you bear the following guidelines in
mind when preparing your article. Some of these are only really appropriate if the
submission is a larger article rather than a small tip, but the differences should be
fairly obvious. We would still rather get submissions than scare you off. </p>

<p><br>
<a name="Sourcecode"></p>

<h3>Sourcecode Guidlines</h3>
</a>

<p>First and foremost, does the code actually work? We do sometimes get code that, for one
reason or another, just does not work. Please check that the source code you send compiles
cleanly, and if part of a larger demo application, that the application itself runs OK. </p>

<p><b>Sample Executable:</b> If providing a sample executable, please make sure it is
linked with the release libraries (eg. Make sure it is not linked with the UNICODE or
debug libraries). The whole point of a demo executable is to give developers a quick intro
to your code. If they have to recomnpile in order to get the application to run on their
system then there is no use in supplying the executable in the first place. Secondly try
to conservative about just how big a sample you upload, a 4Mb sample just isn't going to
interest a lot of people.</p>

<p><b>Sample Project:</b>It is reccomended that you also include a sample project. When
creating a ZIP file for the sample project, please do not include either the Debug or 
the Release directories. They simply inflate the size of the ZIP file. Also, do not
include the *.clw, *.dsw and other such files that are automatically recreated.

<p><b>Style:</b> We cannot (and will not) dictate coding style, but we do ask that the
general MFC guidlines be adhered to so that other programmers can understand your code
easily. Conventions that help other programmers read your code are: 

<ul>
  <li>The use of Hungarian notation (eg Variable prefixes such as &quot;n&quot; for int,
    &quot;d&quot; for double etc.) </li>
  <li>The &quot;m_&quot; prefix for member variables </li>
  <li>The use of MFC types such as UINT, LPCTSTR etc </li>
</ul>

<p>A few other things that you may want to consider when preparing a article are: 

<ul>
  <li>If appropriate, is the code const correct? (And if you don't know what this means the
    answer is probably no).<br>
    That's not necessarily bad BTW, there are classes that I cannot see ever wanting to have
    const versions of. </li>
  <li>Does the code compile cleanly under the highest compiler warning level (that's level 4
    right now)?<br>
    I have to say that if the answer to this is no, then I'd be tempted to tell you to rebuild
    the prog and remove all of the warnings :-) (I might make exceptions for STL based code
    since the current MS libraries simply won't compile cleanly at level 4 and it's arguable
    that using lots of #pragmas rather defeats the whole point.)</li>
  <li>It is OK to use others code as a base as long as you make it totally clear that
    some/most of the code isn't yours, and keep all copyright notices in the original code. </li>
</ul>

<p>I want to re-emphasize this last point (and you can draw your own conclusions as to
why). <strong>If you use someone else's code then DO NOT remove their copyright notices.</strong>
&nbsp; There is a lot of code reuse here, that's the point after all.&nbsp; As far as the
articles that are being posted here we expect to see credit where credit's due, in the
code and the HTML as appropriate.</p>
<a name="Documentation">

<p>While we are talking about copyrights, you retain copyright of your article and code but
by submitting it to CodeGuru you give it permission to use it in a fair manner and also
permit all developers to freely use the code in their own applications - even if they are
commercial. </p>

<h3>Documentation Guidelines</h3>
</a>

<p>First and foremost, <b>we need <i>some</i> documentation</b>. This doesn't have to be
anything fancy, though we don't mind if it is, but if you think about answering the
following questions then you should be off to a good start. I'd like to think that these
are fairly obvious, but this has proved not to be the case :-(. 

<ul>
  <li>What does the code do? </li>
  <li>How do I integrate it with my existing code or how do I use it? </li>
  <li>If there is a similar article on CodeGuru already, then how does this one differ? Why
    would someone want to use your version?</li>
  <li>Is there some aspect of the code that is of particular interest that perhaps wants to be
    covered in the documentation and put on the web page? </li>
  <li>Does the code work under UNICODE? If not, is there a reason? </li>
  <li>What version of MFC was this code built with? Right now this may be fairly obvious, but
    given the inevitable upgrade pace set by Microsoft, this may not remain so obvious.</li>
</ul>

<p>The idea is to give the reader a clear of idea of the purpose of your code, instead of
forcing them to download a project, build it and then hunt around to find out what the
sample does. </p>

<p>The quickest way to get your code posted is to provide a simple HTML file. Our
preferences on documentation are: 

<ol>
  <li>A simple HTML file, edited by a plain text editor, using the <a href="template.zip">template
    HTML file</a> provided, </li>
  <li>A plain ol' text file, </li>
  <li>Everything else. </li>
  <li>HTML file exported from MS Word. </li>
</ol>

<p>All the articles at codeguru.com have the same look and feel which is achieved by only
the most basic HTML features. If you send us a HTML file with different fonts and colours
and fancy bits, chances are it will all be stripped out to make it conform to the codeguru
standard. All documentation is edited <b>by hand</b>, so it can be a real nightmare wading
through masses of horrible HTML produced by such things as MS Word. For hints on how to
make life easy for us here at codeguru, check out the <a
href="submission_guide.shtml#HTMLGuide">guide to simple HTML.</a> </p>

<p><b>Images:</b> If the code is for a GUI element, provide a picture. GIF or jpeg only
please. Please be careful about the size of the image, most people still think that their
modem is too slow, let's not make it any worse than necessary. If you want a specific
guideline, 20K is good, 100K is bad. (If you can't get a picture small enough then try
cutting down on the number of colors used, this can make a huge difference.)</p>

<h3><a name="Bug Fixes, etc.">Bug Fixes, etc.</a></h3>

<p>We are beginning to get a number of modifications to existing posts, which can be a
good thing. In these cases can we ask that you attempt to contact the original author
first and then try to liaise with him/her to produce an update to the original article.
&nbsp; This way we can retain continuity with the original article as well as reducing the
number of completely new pages that need posting.</p>

<h3><a name="Submission">Submitting your article</a></h3>

<p>Please post all your articles to <a href="mailto:submit@codeguru.com">submit@codeguru.com</a>.
Your article will then be forwarded on to the person responsible for the section in which
your article will be posted. Please refrain from posting articles directly to individuals
unless they specifically ask you or are expecting an email from you. </p>

<p>When emailing the article please state the title of the article in the subject line.
Also if you think it neatly fits in one of the categories, please let us know.</p>

<p>If your article comprises code that is more than a few lines long, it is much easier to
send this as a zipped attachment. Embedding it in an email message directly often does
horrible things to the formatting. </p>

<p>If you do want to send an archive, please use a plain zip file rather than a self
extracting executable. Remember that if your project contains long file names, then you
ought to use an appropriately modern zip program to create the archive. InfoZip, WinZIP
and PK-Zip, to name a few products, all have programs that do this correctly. </p>

<p>If appropriate, a small sample project that shows the code in action is helpful. This
is certainly optional but goes some way to letting the reader analyze the usefulness of
your code to him. </p>

<p><b>File naming convention:</b> If your contribution comprises a HTML article, source
code and an image, then to make life easy for us we ask that you follow the following
filename conventions. Suppose your article is called coolcode.html. The filenames should
be of the form:<br>
<br>
</p>

<table width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="30%">coolcode.html</td>
    <td width="70%">The HTML documentation for your article</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="30%">coolcode.zip</td>
    <td width="70%">The zipped source code for your article</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="30%">coolcode.gif</td>
    <td width="70%">An image to accompany your article</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Alternatively, if you have source code, a demo project and a number of images, then
your filenames would be along the lines of:<br>
<br>
</p>

<table width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="30%">coolcode.html</td>
    <td width="70%">The HTML documentation for your article</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="30%">coolcode_src.zip</td>
    <td width="70%">The zipped source code for your article</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="30%">coolcode_demo.zip</td>
    <td width="70%">The zipped demo project for your article</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="30%">coolcode1.gif</td>
    <td width="70%">An image to accompany your article</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="30%">coolcode2.gif</td>
    <td width="70%">A second image to accompany your article</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<a name="HTMLGuide">

<p></a>BTW, don't use the name coolcode, try to find something more relevant :-)<a
name="HTMLGuide"></p>
</a>

<h4><a name="HTMLGuide">What do I mean by Simple HTML?</a></h4>

<p>As you look around this site, you can see that there is a fairly consistent look to it.
To maintain this we want to be able to apply a set of consistent formats to the articles
that we post. To do this we generally do the following when converting text to HTML, or
massaging HTML prior to posting: 

<ul>
  <li>You can ignore everything that you see in the headers and footers of these pages. They
    are all boiler plate code, and we'll paste them into your article for you. </li>
  <li>We want a title for the article. Generally we try to use the one that you choose, though
    sometimes this has to be modified to avoid clashes with other articles. </li>
  <li>We add the contribution line to the article with your name and email address. </li>
  <li>Then we start reformatting stuff. If there are any specific font tags we generally
    remove all of them. This is particularly true of the size modifiers that FrontPage seems
    to insist in riddling its HTML with. </li>
  <li>We add paragraph markers where appropriate to either side of each paragraph. This is a
    &lt;p&gt; ... &lt;/p&gt; pair </li>
  <li>Formatting C or C++ source code takes a bit of care. Generally we want to do this before
    it is embedded in the HTML file since a number of the characters that we want to replace
    occur correctly in the HTML.<br>
    We do a number of search and replaces (the order here matters): <ol>
      <li>Replace <strong><tt>&amp;</tt></strong> with <strong><tt>&amp;amp;</tt></strong> note
        that this <strong>does</strong> include the semi-colon. </li>
      <li>Replace <strong><tt>&lt;</tt></strong> with <strong><tt>&amp;lt;</tt></strong> </li>
      <li>Replace <strong><tt>&gt;</tt></strong> with <strong><tt>&amp;gt;</tt></strong> </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Wrap the whole code section in:<br>
    <strong><tt>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&lt;font COLOR=&quot;#990000&quot;&gt;<br>
    </tt></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your code ...<br>
    <strong><tt>&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</tt></strong> </p>
  </li>
  <li>Any section headings are generally wrapped with <strong><tt>&lt;H4&gt; &lt;/H4&gt;</tt></strong>.
    This is the heading style used in this page. </li>
  <li>As for links to downloadable samples; feel free to add them where appropriate, and we'll
    change them if needed when we post the article. </li>
</ul>

<p>Other than that, a well formed HTML page is likely to be posted quicker than one where
we have to do a lot of work. This means that there may well be a preference when it comes
to posting articles for ones that we can post quickly. </p>

<p>To assist in this process, we've provided a <a href="template.zip">template HTML file</a>,
you certainly don't have to use it, but it may help to get you started. </p>

<p>A final note. A number of articles are from people whose native language is not
English. We want to encourage this to continue. After all, your so called 'bad' English is
nearly always going to be better than my (Guy not Zafir here) attempt at your language, so
please don't let this deter you. If you would feel more comfortable with someone tidying
up your grammar, then just ask. I doubt that we'll rewrite the whole article since we
quite simply don't have the time, but sometimes it only takes a few changes to make the
whole piece more readable. </p>
