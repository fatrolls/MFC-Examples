Yes, updates have been coming more slowly.
My new job is keeping me very busy. The work is
challenging so I am usually mentally drained when
I get home. That means there is little room in this
geek's brain for WFC work.

<P>

I've been giving performance a look. Some things have
been tweaked (like sockets) to give the user more
options. Registry has an escape avenue now (as well
as restoration of hives). Also, I'm beginnig to pull
away from MFC. I'm finding it to be less and less useful
in the applications I write. To that end, I have written
an <CODE>MFC2STL.H</CODE> header file that will get rid
of most of MFC (at least enough to get WFC to compile).
Please feel free to test this version. I wrote the header
(so I could use XML without MFC) but haven't really tested
it.

<P>

I'm pulling away from MFC. I've begun to port utility
classes to STL. STL is <I>almost</I> useful.

<B>wfc_undocumented_get_system_process_list</B> - Uses
the undocumented <B><CODE>NtQuerySystemInformation()</CODE></B>
function to get a list of all processes on a system.<BR>
<B>USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.!!</B>

<P>
<B><A HREF="wfc_enable_privilege.htm">wfc_enable_privilege</A></B> -
Enables a single privilege by name.<P>

<B><A HREF="wfc_enable_all_privileges.htm">wfc_enable_all_privileges</A></B> -
Enables all known privileges on the system.<P>

<B><A HREF="wfc_get_filename_from_handle.htm" TARGET="Explain">wfc_get_filename_from_handle</A></B> - 
C function that returns the file name given a file's handle. It
uses the partially documented <CODE>NtQueryInformationFile</CODE> to
perform this magic.<P>

<B><A HREF="wfc_set_thread_name.htm" TARGET="Explain">wfc_set_thread_name</A></B> -
A function that allows you to set a string constant as the &quot;name&quot;
of a thread. Really handy when debugging multi-threaded programs.<P>

<B><A HREF="CFile64.htm">CFile64</A></B> - A variant of
the MFC <CODE>CFile</CODE> class except it will allow
you to access large files (larger than 4GB). It should
work with files up to 18 billion terabytes in size. To be
safe, I suggest using the class on files of only 9 billion
terabytes in size (I may have a signed/unsigned
problem somewhere). I wrote this in an effort to get
a wonderful
<A HREF="http://members.tripod.com/AndrewPhillips/">freeware hex editor</A>
to handle large files.<P>

<B>ListProcesses</B> - This sample program shows how to get a list of
all running processes in the system.<P>

<B><A HREF="CDataFile.htm">CDataFile</A></B> -
Now reads a data chunk in two Read() calls instead
of three (helps in busy servers).

<P>

<B><A HREF="CQueue.htm">CQueue</A></B> - 
Fixed a race condition.
Thanks to Lou Franco (lfranco@spheresoft.com)
for finding this nasty little bug. After putting his
changes in, queue speed slowed to 289,000 operations
per second (instead of 387,000 per second) but it no 
longer locks up on multi-cpu systems. I ran a test over
a weekend and performed over 64 billion queue operations.
I think it is solid now.

<P>

<B><A HREF="CRandomNumberGenerator2.htm">CRandomNumberGenerator2</A></B> -
Got rid of three static variables that were never used.

<P>

<B><A HREF="SOCKETS.HTM">CSimpleSocket</A></B> - 
Updated <B>TranslateErrorCode()</B> to include
quality of service error codes. Also fixed
thunk initialization code to get rid of variables
getting munched in multi-cpu machines. Also added a
<B><CODE>SetSocketOption</CODE></B> method that
snaps to <CODE>setsockopt.</CODE>

<P>

<B>CSimpleSocketFile</B> - Fixed a UNICODE compilation problem.
