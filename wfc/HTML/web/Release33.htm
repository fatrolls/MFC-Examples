<H1>Release 33</H1>
In summary, I've fixed some design problems
with XML document creation and discovered where
Microsoft screwed me again in the networking API.<P>
I'm happy with the features of this release so I will
now turn my attention to UNICODE problems. Look for
Release 34 to address UNICODE issues.
<H2>What's New</H2>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B><A HREF="CXMLArchive.htm">CXMLArchive</A></B><DD>This class
is modeled after the CArchive MFC class. It allows
you to serialize (or persist) objects to and from
XML documents.
<DT><B><A HREF="wfc_parse_iso_8601_string.htm">wfc_parse_iso_8601_string</A></B><DD>
This function parses ISO8601 dates into a CTime or COleDateTime object.
<DT><B>XMLUser Sample</B><DD>This
sample program shows you how to use the
<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/" TARGET="_parent">XML</A>
classes to
create a document. It dumps the user database from
one (or more) machines to an
<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/" TARGET="_parent">XML</A>
file. It shows how to use the
<A HREF="CXMLArchive.htm">CXMLArchive</A> class.

<H2>Bug Fixes/Enhancements</H2>
<B><A HREF="CXMLD.htm">CExtensibleMarkupLanguageDocument</A></B> - 
Reviewed for const correctness.<P>

<B><A HREF="CXMLE.htm">CExtensibleMarkupLanguageElement</A></B> - 
Made it a lot easier (and possible) to create
<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/" TARGET="_parent">XML</A>
documents. I also reviewed it for const correctness.
I got so caught up in trying to get Release 32 out the door,
I released a brain-dead object. You could parse
<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/" TARGET="_parent">XML</A>
documents but you couldn't create them. Pretty silly.
<P>

<B><A HREF="CNetwork.htm">CNetwork</A></B> - Added a new protected data memeber
because Microsoft changed (again) the personality of a networking API.<P>

<B><A HREF="CSimpleSocket.htm">CSimpleSocket</A></B> - 
Thanks go to zschen (zschen@ms.chttl.com.tw) for founding a bug in
the Write( CString ) method where I wasn't sending the trailing NULL.
It is fixed now.<P>
