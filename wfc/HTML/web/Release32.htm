<H1>NOTE!</H1>
I found a late bug! If you downloaded WFC.ZIP before
6pm EST on the 9th of March, please download the new
WFC.ZIP. There was a bug in SOCKETS.CPP. Sorry...
<H1>Release 32</H1>
Lots of work at glacial speeds. I can't  believe it has taken
me seven months to get this release out. My real job is heating
up. I've been working on two major projects (one of which
is a multi-OS generic class library to encapsulate Input-Process-Output
computing problems, lesson learned: <STRONG>UNIX SUCKS!</STRONG>)
and several minor
projects. When I get home, I'm tired of coding. I think part of the
problem is WFC has almost everything I need to get my job done. In short,
I'm running out of ideas. I was also distracted by the nagging
question of &quot;How far is it from here to there?&quot; Take a look
at GFC on my <A HREF="homepage.htm" TARGET="_parent">home page</A> and you will see
what I mean.
<H2>What's New</H2>

<H2>Bug Fixes/Enhancements</H2>
<B>Mixer Classes</B> - Sean Dynan (sdynan@cccgroup.co.uk) pointed out
a flaw in the design of the lesser classes. They had different prototypes
for <B>Open</B>() than
<A HREF="CMixer.htm">CMixer</A>::<B>Open</B>().
These are now fixed so window handles
can be used in classes like <B>CMixerSpeakers</B>.<P>
<B><A HREF="CQueue.htm">CQueue</A></B> - You can now add pointers to the queue.<P>
<B><A HREF="REGISTRY.htm">CRegistry</A></B> - Thanks to Ravi Kiran (kravi@blr.sni.de) for finding a bug in
the <B>SetStringValue</B>() method. I was only sending half the bytes
of a UNICODE string. DOH!<P>
<B><A HREF="CRAS.htm">CRemoteAccessService</A></B> - I now thunk all RAS calls.<P>
<B><A HREF="Serial.htm">CSerialFile</A></B> - Fixed a problem with MFC. The CFile::Write() method
incorrectly handles writes that don't write the full number of bytes but
also does not error out. <A HREF="Serial.htm">CSerialFile</A>::<B>Write</B>() now spoon feeds WriteFile().<P>
<B><A HREF="SOCKETS.htm">CSimpleSocket</A></B> - I now thunk all of the WinSock calls. This is 
to ease going between Win95 (hacked up piece of garbage) and NT (a real
operating system). Also, the <B>Close</B>() method does not reset
the data members. This makes for a significant speed up for applications
like port scanners.<P>
<B>CTalkingSocket</B> - The <B>Open</B>() method now checks to see
if the socket is already open. If it is, it will close the first
connection.
<H3>In General</H3>
I added another utility function <CODE>wfc_close_handle</CODE>()
that is used in place of the <B>CloseHandle</B>() Win32 API. This
function spits out a warning message if <B>CloseHandle</B>() fails.
(This helps when debugging.)<P>
<H3>In General 2</H3>
Sergey Rapoport [serge_rapoport@bigfoot.com] pointed
out a bug in a <A HREF="CNetwork.htm">CNetwork</A> family of classes. It seems Microsoft
changed the personality of the networking API. I modified the logic
of all affected classes so they will now enumerate properly when all
items have been retrieved in a single retrieve call.<P>
<B><A HREF="Serial.htm">CSerialFile</A></B> - As requested by Angelini Fabio [fabioang@iol.it],
There is now a <B>Write</B>() method that writes a single byte.<P>
<H3>In General 3</H3>
Somewhere along the line, exception throwing was added to <CODE>new</CODE>.
I added <CODE>try/catch</CODE> blocks around all calls to the <CODE>new</CODE>
operator in WFC.
<H3>HTML INCLUDED!</H3>
I got a
<A HREF="http://home.worldonline.nl/~tonswart/" TARGET="_parent">smurf</A>y
idea, why not let users surf the web pages at home?
I created a directory under WFC called HTML. There's a batch file
in there called <CODE>gather.cmd</CODE>. Run this puppy (you must
build the HTML sample program first) and it will create the WFC
web site in that directory! Then all you have to do is click on
the WFC.HTM file and you can navigate all of the documentation.
I removed all hard references and made the relative paths. I also
modified the <CODE>paxit.cmd</CODE> file so when I create the distribution
package, it will pull in the needed HTML files.
