<H2>Bug Fixes/Enhancements</H2>
<B>In General</B> - Alexander Kiesl [Alexander.Kiesl@mch.sni.de] found
a bug in <B><A HREF="serial.htm">CSerialFile</A>::ConfigurationDialog()</B>.
The Win32 API <B>CommConfigDialog<B>() is defined as BOOL but was
not returning TRUE or FALSE. Upon closer examination of the documentation
for <B>CommConfigDialog</B>(), it says it will return zero on failure
and non-zero on success. This is nice <B>BUT IT AIN'T BOOLEAN!</B>
I had to reverse my logic for detecting failure from
<CODE>return_value != TRUE</CODE> to <CODE>return_value == FALSE</CODE>
whenever I called <B>ANY</B> Win32 API anywhere in WFC. For the moment,
it looks like Microsoft's definition of BOOL is &quot;zero or something
else.&quot; Interestingly, this definition applies to all non-void
functions. In short, TRUE is not a valid return value from any Win32
API call and should never be used in any conditional expression.
Only FALSE is valid. WFC now only checks for FALSE being
returned from a BOOL function. However, you are guaranteed that any
WFC function of type BOOL will return only TRUE or FALSE. Unlike the
author of <B>CommConfigDialog</B>(), I understand the difference
between BOOL and int.<P>
<B>In General 2</B> - WFC is now UNICODE correct! Well, almost. The
socket classes are still not correct but they will be RSN (real
soon now). WFC uses the gender neutral versions of string functions.
For example, <CODE>sprintf()</CODE> becomes <CODE>_stprintf()</CODE>.
This was a lot of work. Like
<A HREF="http://www.i-cafe.net/donc/" TARGET="_parent">John Wayne</A>
said, &quot;Life is tough. It's tougher if you're stupid.&quot; Converting
to UNICODE was pretty darned tough. I had to edit every method of
every class in WFC.<P>
<B>In General 3</B> - All sample applications have been converted to
Visual C++ 5.0.<P>
<B>CDeviceControlBlock</B> - The <B>Dump</B>() method present only
in the debug build, now breaks out the meanings of the data members
(i.e. breaks the bit fields out to text).<P>
<B><A HREF="registry.htm">CRegistry</A></B> - Paul Ostrowski (postrowski@xantel.com)
found many many places where I was not UNICODE correct. This caused
me to review <I>all</I> of WFC for UNICODE correctness. It took an
enormous amount of time. I was stupid not to have done this since
the beginning. Oh well, live and learn.<P>
<B><A HREF="ServiceConfiguration.htm">CServiceConfiguration</A></B> - 
Ullrich Pollaehne (Ullrich_Pollaehne@ka2.maus.de) found a bug where
I was handling double-NULL terminated strings in a silly manner.
<B><A HREF="CSvcMgr.htm">CServiceControlManager</B></B> - 
Ullrich Pollaehne (Ullrich_Pollaehne@ka2.maus.de) has done a
magnificent job of finding my laziness in the <B>EnumerateStatus</B>()
method. It will now enumerate more than 128 entries (which you can
easily get by enumerating all services). 
<B><A HREF="SOCKETS.htm">CSimpleSocket</A></B> - Angelini Fabio (fabioang@iol.it)
uncovered my stupidity in not handling a zero-bytes-read condition on the
<B>Read</B>() method.<P>
<B><A HREF="CSystemTime.htm">CSystemTime</A></B> - Has new <B>Get</B>()
and <B>Set</B>()
methods that get the time from the computer and set the time on the
computer.<P>
<B>CWfcTrace</B> - I was catching some flak about the amount of debugging
messages that WFC spits out. I modified the class (don't worry, your code
won't change) so it supports 32 independent levels of debugging messages. By default,
only debugging messages from your application will be sent to the debug
window. If you want to see WFC's debugging statements, you must call
WFCTRACELEVELON( 31 ), which will turn on level 31's messages.<P>
<H2>New Classes</H2>
<B><A HREF="CFileTransferProtocol.htm">CFileTransferProtocol</A></B> - Makes
it a little easier to play with ftp. It retrieves directory listings
or files. Easier to use than the MFC counterparts.<P>
<B><A HREF="wfc_am_i_administrator.htm">wfc_am_i_administrator</A></B> - C Function
that returns TRUE if you have Administrator priveleges.<P>
