Well, Microsoft did it again. They changed a header file
and broke my code (see rules 1 and 2 of my
<A HREF="Coding.htm">coding guidelines</A>) in the networking
classes. With the February 2000 version of the Platform SDK, they
introduced a new string type, <CODE><B>LMSTR</B></CODE>. Happy
happy, joy joy.

<H3>New Samples</H3>

I've added a couple of new sample programs. One is ADO2XML
which shows you how to dump any database to XML format. ADO
sits on top of OLE DB which provides universal data access.
It is very cool stuff. The only problem is it is COM objects
wrapped by Microsoft code. Microsoft loves to use C++ exception
handling which leads to code bloat. Every stinking call into
the classes that wrap ADO must be surrounded by a
<CODE>try</CODE> and two <CODE>catch</CODE> blocks. That is a
lot of typing. To make matters worse, you're having to use
components instead of classes. Components can be great but the
bad part about them (COM <I>or</I> CORBA) is if functionality is not
exposed in the interface, you're just plain stuck. If you had
source code, you could figure out what a method is <I>trying</I>
to do and fix it. With components, you can't do anything except
hack and hack and hack and hack away at it until it doesn't die
any more. With ADO, I've suffered through this kind of muck.
In the development of ADO2XML, I've been reading a Microsoft
Access 97 database. Some of the lesson's learned while developing
ADO-based programs are:

<OL>

<LI><B>ADO doesn't play well with threads</B>.
If your application is
multithreaded, you must code it so that all ADO calls come from
the same thread. It doesn't matter what threading model you started
COM with (i.e. <CODE>CoInitializeEx( COINIT_MULTITHREADED )</CODE>).
The problem is ADO may be multithreaded but the underlying data source
may not be. ADO doesn't handle this situation very well.
Also, you need to test this as it depends on what database
source you are connected to. This really sucks when you have to 
support data sources with different personalities at run time (like
Access and SQL server). From what I've learned of COM, it doesn't
do threads very well at all. Almost as if the Windows 95 developers
worked on COM. I will be writing an article on coding around COM to
fix these kinds of problems in a generic fashion.

<LI><B>Exception handling sucks!</B>
COM/OLE is filled with wonderfully
descriptive error codes like E_FAIL (0x80004005L)
and E_FAIL (0x80000008L). Microsoft has this uncanny ability to
be 100% accurate and completely useless all at the same time.
To make a long store short, if you get incomplete exception
information from a failed call, go to the object closest to
the functionality and try it there. COM must have a problem
propagating exceptions. For example, I was getting an exception
thrown from the recordset class/object/interface method <CODE>AddNew()</CODE>
It basically said &quot;an error occurred.&quot; I recoded it as
a SQL statement and passed to the connection class/object/interface
method <CODE>Execute()</CODE>. It failed again but this time I got
the error message in the exception (I was sending a NULL field to an
Access table that had a field that didn't allow NULL in that
particular field). Like I said, hack and hack and hack and hack . . .

<H2>Modified</H2>

<B><A HREF="WfcTrace.htm">WFCTRACE</A></B> - Now handles variant type.<P>

<B><A HREF="Registry.htm">CRegistry</A></B>
Added the ability to read and write a key's default value.<P>

<B><A HREF="CService.htm">CService</A></B> - Added a typecast for a handle type.<P>

STL Arrays - The drop-in replacements for CByteArray, CPtrArray,
CStringArray, CWordArray, CUINTArray and CDWordArray based on STL
have been fixed. There was a problem in the <CODE>Copy()</CODE>
method. I have also added test cases to the TEST
<A HREF="samples.htm">sample</A>
project for these classes.<P>

<B><A HREF="lmerr.htm">Convert_NERR_Code_to_String()</A></B> - Changed a couple of defined constants
back to mathematical formulas for folks that have old compilers. This allows
me to convert error codes that don't have <CODE>#define</CODE>'d constants.<P>

<B>CServiceControlManager</B> - Fixed a bug in the <CODE>Install()</CODE> method.
Well, actually, it is Microsoft's bug in NT. If an executable path name contains
a space (like C:\Program&nbsp;Files\myservice.exe), if you don't put quotation marks
around the executable name, the service control manager (SCM) will report an &quot;invalid
Windows NT application&quot; error. I added code to make sure the executable name
is surrounded by quotes if needed.<P>
